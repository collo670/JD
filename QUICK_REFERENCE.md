## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Data is Local Only** - All data saves to your browser's localStorage, not the cloud
2. **Device-Specific** - Data doesn't sync across devices. Each device has its own copy
3. **Cache Impact** - Clearing browser cache will delete all stored data
4. **Offline Mode** - Works completely offline. Changes save when you're back online
5. **No Backup** - Always keep important records backed up

---

## üÜò Common Issues

**Q: My data disappeared after clearing cache**  
A: Browser cache includes localStorage. Use "Clear specific items" instead of "Clear all."

**Q: Can I see my data on another device?**  
A: Not automatically. Each device has separate localStorage. Plan for cloud sync in future.

**Q: How do I export my data?**  
A: Use browser developer tools (F12) ‚Üí Application ‚Üí LocalStorage to view and copy JSON.

**Q: Can I undo a deletion?**  
A: Not yet. Be careful with delete button. This feature will be added soon.

**Q: Forms won't submit - what's wrong?**  
A: Make sure all required fields (with \*) are filled and valid.

## üìû Tips & Tricks

- **Double-check before delete** - There's a confirmation dialog, but data removal is permanent
- **Use consistent date format** - The date picker helps ensure consistency
- **Full names for suppliers** - Makes searching and filtering easier
- **Include quantities with units** - e.g., "24 bottles", "500 L" (helps with clarity)
- **Regular exports** - Copy your localStorage data regularly as backup
